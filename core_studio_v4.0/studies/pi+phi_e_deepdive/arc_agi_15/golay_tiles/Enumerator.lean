# The weight enumerator of *any* code with the four defining properties

`IsGolay` is the four defining properties.  That they pin the extended Golay
code down *up to equivalence* is the one standard fact this set quotes rather
than proves.

Full uniqueness is therefore not proved here.  What *is* proved is the first
half of it, and the half everything else leans on: **every** code satisfying the
four properties — dimension 12, self-orthogonal, doubly even, minimum weight 8 —
has the Golay weight distribution

    1, 759, 2576, 759, 1

on weights `0, 8, 12, 16, 24`.  So the numbers `Surface.lean`,
`Turyn.lean` and `Stabiliser.lean` each verify by enumeration for their
particular code are not properties of those constructions: they follow from the
definition, for every code that meets it.

The proof uses only what `Steiner.lean` already established, and no
MacWilliams identity:

* `octad_count` — double counting 5-sets against octads.  Every 5-set lies in
  exactly one octad (`unique_octad`) and every octad contains `C(8,5) = 56` of
  them, so there are `C(24,5) / 56 = 759` octads.
* `card_wt_eq_eight` — a codeword is determined by its support, so the weight-8
  words are in bijection with the octads.
* `card_wt_eq_sixteen` — complementation is an involution of the code carrying
  weight 8 to weight 16.
* `card_wt_eq_twelve` — what is left of the 4096 codewords.
