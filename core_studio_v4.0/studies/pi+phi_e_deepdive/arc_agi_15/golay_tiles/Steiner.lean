# The octads of a Golay code form a Steiner system `S(5,8,24)`

Second of the three files.  `Code.lean` proved that exactly `2^(12-k)`
codewords carry any prescribed pattern on `k ≤ 7` coordinates.  That is enough
to pin the number of octads through five given points, by counting moments —
no weight enumerator, no MacWilliams identity, no uniqueness theorem.

Fix a 5-set `T` and let `A` be the codewords that are `1` all over `T`.  Then

* `|A| = 2^7 = 128`;
* summing `wt c - 5` over `A` counts pairs *(codeword, point outside `T` it
  covers)*, which is `19 · 2^6`;
* summing `(wt c - 5) choose 2` counts pairs *(codeword, 2-set outside `T` it
  covers)*, which is `171 · 2^5`.

Every word of `A` has weight `8`, `12`, `16` or `24`, and only the all-ones
word has weight 24.  Three linear equations in three unknowns then force

    #octads through T = 1,   #weight-12 words = 48,   #weight-16 words = 78.

`unique_octad` is the first of these: **any five of the 24 points lie in exactly
one octad**, which is the Steiner system `S(5,8,24)`.
