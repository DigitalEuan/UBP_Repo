# No Golay code on the cube's surface survives a diagonal mirror

Third and last of the three files, and the one that closes the last gap in the
symmetry table:

> **No** Golay code on the cube's surface is invariant under the full
> 48-element group `O_h`, nor under `T_d`.

It is proved here, not searched for.  One element of `T_d` already settles it, and the reason is
a parity count.

## The argument

A *diagonal mirror* of the cube — the reflection that swaps two axes, `sigmaD`
below — acts on the 24 surface cells as an involution with **exactly four fixed
cells** (`sigmaD_fixed_card`): the four quadrants of the two faces it fixes that
lie on the mirror plane.

Now suppose some Golay code `C` on those 24 cells were invariant under it.  By
`GolayInv.unique_octad` the octads of `C` form a Steiner system `S(5,8,24)`,
so every 5-set lies in exactly one octad; if the 5-set is carried to itself by
the mirror, so is its octad.  Count the mirror-invariant 5-sets, sorted by which
octad they lie in:

* there are `4 · C(10,2) + C(4,3) · 10 = 220` of them (`inv5_card`);
* an invariant octad meets the four fixed cells in an even number of points, so
  in `0`, `2` or `4` of them, and contains respectively `4`, `3` or `2` mirror
  pairs.  The invariant 5-subsets it contains therefore number `0`, `6` or `12`
  (`six_dvd_fiber`) — always a multiple of six.

So `6 ∣ 220`, which is false.  No such code exists — for **any** placement of
**any** Golay code on the surface, not merely the ones a search reached.

Since a diagonal mirror lies in `T_d` and in `O_h`, both negative rows of the
report's table are now theorems: `no_Td_invariant_golay`, `no_Oh_invariant_golay`.
The positive rows stay as they were (`CubeStab.oCode_rotations_free`).

## The one caveat

`IsGolay` asks for the four standard defining properties of the extended Golay
code — dimension 12, self-orthogonal, doubly even, minimum weight 8.  The Python
search asked only for dimension 12 and minimum weight 8, and appealed to
uniqueness for the rest.  The two agree on every code either could mean, but
the identification is a classification theorem that is not proved here.
