# Three cubes: what the proposed rules actually give, and what does give the Golay code

`test_8_three_cube.py` proposes splitting the 24 cells into **three parallel
3-cubes** of 8 vertices, with three hierarchical rules:

* **Rule A** — each cube's six face parities are even (the script calls the
  resulting code `RM(2,3)`);
* **Rule B** — corresponding faces across the three cubes align (their parities
  sum to an even number);
* **Rule C** — the total weight is one of `0, 8, 12, 16, 24`.

This file checks that proposal exactly, and then repairs it.

## What the rules give (measured, not asserted)

* `ruleA_card` — the Rule-A cubes are **16** patterns, not `2^7`: Rule A is the
  first-order Reed–Muller code `RM(1,3)`, the affine functions of `(x,y,z)`
  (`ruleA_iff_affine`), **not** `RM(2,3)`, which is the 128-word even-weight
  code (`rm2_card`).  The label in the script is off by one order.
* `ruleB_of_ruleA` — Rule B is **empty as a constraint**: if every cube passes
  Rule A then every face parity is `0`, so the cross-cube sums are automatically
  even.  Rule B rejects nothing that Rule A accepts.
* `ruleA_min_weight`, `ruleA_weight_four_witness` — the three-cube Rule-A code
  is a `[24, 12, 4]` code: the right size (`ruleAB_card`, `2^12` words, the same
  as the Golay code), but minimum distance **4**, so it corrects one cell error,
  not three.
* `ruleC_is_a_real_filter` — Rule C therefore does bite: there are Rule-A/B
  words of weight 4.  But it destroys linearity (`ruleAC_not_linear`), so the
  filtered set is no longer a code one can compose in.
* `ruleA_code_is_not_golay` — and no relabelling of the 24 cells can fix this:
  the transported Rule-A code always contains a weight-4 word, while every
  nonzero MOG codeword has weight ≥ 8.

## What does work: Turyn's glue

Keeping the user's three cubes but changing the *glue* recovers everything.
With `A = RM(1,3)` (Rule A) and a second copy `A ∘ σ` of it obtained by the
explicit vertex relabelling `σ = ![0,1,2,4,3,6,7,5]`, put

    cube₀ = a + x,   cube₁ = b + x,   cube₂ = a + b + x     (`turyn`)

for `a, b ∈ A` and `x ∈ A ∘ σ`.  Then:

* `turyn_add`, `ruleA_add` — the construction is linear;
* `turyn_injective`, `turynCode_card` — `2^12 = 4096` codewords;
* `turyn_min_weight` — minimum weight **8**;
* `turyn_weight_enumerator` — weights `1, 759, 2576, 759, 1`, exactly the MOG
  enumerator of `CubeMOG.mog_weight_enumerator`.

So the three-cube picture *does* carry the Golay code — three 8-cell cubes,
each an affine-function cube, glued by a shared third word — provided the glue
is `(a+x, b+x, a+b+x)` and not a parity rule between corresponding faces.
(That these two `[24,12,8]` codes are the *same* code up to relabelling is the
classical uniqueness theorem for the binary Golay code; it is **not** proved
here.  What is proved here is that they have identical parameters and identical
weight enumerators.)
