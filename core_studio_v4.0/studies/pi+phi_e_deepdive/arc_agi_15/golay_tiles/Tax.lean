# The price list of the cube's instruction set

The tile calculus partitions the cube's operations:

* **free / reversible** — XOR with a codeword, and the code-preserving
  symmetries (`Stabiliser`);
* **priced** — nonlinear face transforms (AND, OR), which produce a nonzero
  syndrome and cost `HW(leader σ)·Q ≤ 4Q`;
* **certified repair** — the snap back into the code, unique when the damage is
  at most 3 cells;
* **ambiguous** — results at distance 4, where the cube must genuinely read.

This file proves the arithmetic that makes that price list true, in particular
the bound `≤ 4Q` and its sharpness.

## What is proved

* `synd` — the 12-bit syndrome of a grid: three GF(4) hexacode checks (faces
  3, 4, 5 against the re-encoding of faces 0, 1, 2) and six parity checks.
  `synd_eq_zero_iff` : `synd g = 0 ↔ IsMog g`; `synd_gxor` : it is linear.
* `leader` — a coset leader for each of the 4096 syndromes, produced by
  searching all `12951` grids of weight `≤ 4` (`leader_ok`, by evaluation).
* `covering_radius_le_four` : **every** grid is within 4 cells of a codeword,
  hence `tax_le_four_Q` : the repair of any damage costs at most `4·Q`.
* `covering_radius_ge_four` : the bound is attained — a weight-4 grid is at
  distance exactly 4 from the code (its own coset has no smaller member), so
  `4Q` is not a pessimistic estimate but the true worst case.
* `repair_unique_of_le_three` : below the boundary the repair is unique, and
  `repair_ambiguous_at_four` : at 4 it is not.
* `and_is_priced` : AND of two codewords need not be a codeword — the concrete
  reason the nonlinear class is priced at all — and `and_repair_le_four_Q`
  bounds its repair.
