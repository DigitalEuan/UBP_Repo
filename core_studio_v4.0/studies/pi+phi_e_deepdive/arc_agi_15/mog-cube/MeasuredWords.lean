# Words with measurable content on the cube

The brief asks to start from words whose information is *tangible and
measurable*, so that the logic is computable.  The most tangible content a
physics word has is its **dimension**: the exponents of the six base quantities

    L (length), M (mass), T (time), I (current), Θ (temperature), N (amount).

This file puts that content on the cube and proves exactly what the substrate
can and cannot decide about it.

**The encoding.**  Dimension `d` is carried by the top cell of face `d`
(`dimWord`).  The remaining cells are filled in by the code, so *every* word is
a lawful codeword: a measurable word costs nothing to hold.  Multiplying two
quantities adds their dimension vectors, and that is exactly XOR of their
codewords (`dimWord_mul`) — the free, `TAX = 0` operation of the substrate.

**What it decides.**  An equation is accepted iff the two sides' codewords are
equal, and `dimWord_eq_iff` says precisely when that happens: iff the exponents
agree **mod 2**.  So

* `E = mc²`, `F = ma`, `E = ħ/t`, `p = mv`, `P = E/t`, `Q = It` are accepted
  (`accepts_true_equations`), and they are true;
* `E = mc` is rejected (`rejects_energy_eq_mass_velocity`), and it is false;
* `E = mc⁴` is **accepted although it is false**
  (`mod_two_blindness_witness`) — the exponents differ by 2.

**Why that ceiling is unavoidable.**  `xor_encoding_is_mod_two`: *any* encoding
of dimension vectors into the substrate for which composition is XOR is blind
to exponent differences of 2.  This is not a defect of the placement chosen
here; it is what characteristic 2 costs.  Getting beyond it needs a nonlinear
(priced) operation, not a better linear code.

**The price structure is sharp.**  A rejected equation is a nonzero codeword,
so by the minimum weight its tax is at least `8·Q` (`detected_error_min_tax`),
while an accepted one costs `0` (`accepted_tax_zero`).  There is nothing in
between: the substrate either sees a dimensional error at full price or does
not see it at all.

**One dimension per face.**  Dimension `d` lives on face `d`, so losing a face
is losing one dimension's channel — and that is repairable
(`dimension_channel_repairable`, a corollary of `face_erasure_correctable`).
