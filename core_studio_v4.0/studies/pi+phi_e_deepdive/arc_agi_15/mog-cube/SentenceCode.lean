# Putting the sentences on the cube

`Semantics.lean` and `Chat.lean` build meaning; `GolayTiles/Turyn.lean` builds a
`[24, 12, 8]` code out of three 8-vertex cubes.  This file joins them: a clause
of the language is *stored* as a three-cube codeword, so the substrate carries
the sentence and protects it.

## The frame

A clause — "the water is not hotter than the stone" — is three fields:

* **subject** (4 bits): which thing, and whether the clause is asserted or
  denied;
* **predicate** (4 bits): which of the six measured properties or relations;
* **object** (4 bits): the second thing, or "none".

Each 4-bit field is one Rule-A (affine) cube, and the three cubes are glued by
Turyn's rule `cube₀ = a + x`, `cube₁ = b + x`, `cube₂ = a + b + x`.  This is the
"face as function" idea in the attached scripts made exact: the third cube is
*computed*, not stored (`third_cube_is_computed`), and the glue is read straight
back off the record (`glue_recoverable`) — no search, no XOR-as-composition,
just a determined value.

## What is proved

* `clauseCode_injective` — the 60 clauses of the vocabulary get 60 distinct
  records: no two meanings collide (this was the failure mode of the earlier
  word-encoding runs).
* `clause_min_distance` — and any two of them differ in **at least 8 of the 24
  cells**.
* `clause_unique_decoding` — hence a clause damaged in up to **3 cells** is
  still recognised uniquely: the sentence survives damage that the parity-only
  layer could not have survived.
* `clause_repair_bound` — 3 is the guarantee, not the limit of ambition: it
  comes from the distance 8 established in `ThreeCube.turyn_min_weight`.
