# The integer companion: carrying the *magnitude*, not just the parity

`MeasuredWords` put a word's dimension on the cube with one **bit** per face and
composed by XOR.  `MeasuredSentences` then measured the damage: of the 1758
sentences the cube accepted, **1402 were false** — precision ≈ 20% — because XOR
sees each exponent only mod 2.

This file implements the fix asked for in `test_5_three_ideas.py` /
`test_6_precision_wall.py`, but *inside* the cube rather than beside it.

**The encoding.**  Each face keeps all four of its cells, and the four cells of
face `j` are the four binary digits of the exponent of dimension `j`, written in
two's complement.  A face therefore holds an integer in `[-8, 7]`
(`intOfCol_range`), not a parity bit: `encG` (`Dim → Grid`) is a genuine integer
record on the same 24 cells.

**The composition.**  `addCol` is a ripple-carry adder wired across the four
cells of a face, and `addG` runs it on all six faces at once.  It is exactly
addition of the stored integers (`addCol_spec`), so multiplying two quantities
is adding their words (`encG_add`) — deterministic, and reversible by
`subG` (`subG_addG`).

**Why this is not XOR.**  XOR *is* the same circuit with the carry wire cut
(`xor_is_add_without_carry`: they agree exactly when no carry is generated).
The carry is precisely the information XOR throws away: `gxorCol c c = 0` always
(`xor_forgets`), while `addCol c c` doubles (`add_remembers`).

**What it buys, counted.**  Re-running the `MeasuredSentences` experiment with
the integer cube: the accepted set is *exactly* the set of true sentences
(`integer_accepts_eq_equations`), i.e. 356 accepted, **0 false positives**
(`integer_false_positive_count`), against 1402 for the parity cube.  Precision
goes from `356/1758` to `356/356`.

**What it costs, honestly.**  An integer word is essentially never a codeword:
*none* of the 156 phrases lands in the code (`phrase_codeword_count`), so the
free-storage property of the parity encoding is lost outright; what survives is
the bound `4·Q` on returning any word to the code (`encG_tax_le_four`).

**Where it still fails.**  The window is finite, so exponents differing by 16
collide (`wrap_blindness_witness`), and no encoding into 24 cells can avoid
some collision (`no_faithful_encoding`).  The gain is that the blind spot moved
from "differs by 2" to "differs by 16" — from inside the vocabulary to far
outside it.
