# One cube per role, and a chain of clauses on the code

Report 2 §7.1, the first thing that was *not* achieved:

> **The 24 cells cannot be a dimension record and a clause record at once.**
> `IntegerCube.encG` and `SentenceCode.clauseCode` are two different uses of the
> same surface.  A working system needs one cube per role and a discipline for
> addressing them; nothing here provides that.

And §8: *"Extending to a chain of clauses is where `because` and `if` would
become codeword-level operations rather than sentence-level ones."*

This file provides the discipline.

## The frame

Every record on the surface is one Turyn codeword built from three four-bit
fields, and the discipline is a fixed reading of those twelve bits:

    field 0 :  role (2 bits) ‖ payload (2 bits)
    field 1 :  payload (4 bits)
    field 2 :  payload (4 bits)

so there are four **roles** — `dimension`, `clause`, `link`, `spare` — each with
its own 10-bit address space of 1024 records (`role_capacity`).  A dimension
record holds five exponents; a clause record holds a literal of the language; a
link record holds a connective and the addresses of the two clauses it joins.

## What is proved

* `rec_min_distance` — any two different records differ in at least 8 of the 24
  cells.  This is proved from linearity of the Turyn construction plus one
  finite weight check over the 4096 records, not by comparing 4096² pairs.
* `roles_are_separated` — in particular a dimension record and a clause record
  are never within 7 cells of each other, which is exactly the confusion
  report 2 §7.1 complained about.
* `decodeRec_correct` — any record damaged in up to 3 cells decodes back to
  itself, uniquely, *including its role*.
* `link_is_a_codeword_operation` — `because` between two clauses is itself a
  record on the surface: it has an address, a distance-8 guarantee, and repairs
  like any other.
* `repaired_store_is_still_sound` — the payoff.  If a store is semantically
  sound (every clause true now, every `because` link licensed by the timed
  connective of `Causation.lean`) and every record is damaged in at most 3
  cells, then what is read back is the same store, so the reasoning survives
  the damage.
