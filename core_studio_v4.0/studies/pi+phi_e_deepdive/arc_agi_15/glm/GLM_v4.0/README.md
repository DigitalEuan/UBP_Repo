# GLM — Geometric Language Machine

**Version:** 4.0.0

## What Is This?

A deterministic, geometry-grounded language engine built on the 24-bit Golay/Leech substrate. Every word has a 24-bit Golay codeword. Every relationship is a labeled edge in a knowledge graph. Every response is structured as Three Column Thinking — language, math, and code aligned at each step.

This is NOT an LLM. It has no neural weights, no training on internet-scale data, no sampling. It's a different kind of intelligence — grounded in error-correcting codes and geometric algebra.

---

## Quick Start

```python
from GLM import GLM

rt = GLM()

# Ask a question
print(rt.chat("What is gravity?"))

# See all three columns (language + math + script)
print(rt.chat_verbose("What is a quark?"))

# Learn from text
rt.learn("Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light into energy.")
print(rt.chat("What is photosynthesis?"))

# Multi-turn conversation
print(rt.chat("What is the hamiltonian?"))
print(rt.chat("How does it relate to symmetry?"))  # context-aware
```

### CLI

```bash
python3 GLM.py --chat "What is gravity?"
python3 GLM.py --verbose "What is a quark?"
python3 GLM.py --learn "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light into energy."
python3 GLM.py --interactive
python3 GLM.py --status
```

---

## How It Works

### The Substrate

Every word in the GLM vocabulary has a 24-bit vector derived from SVD co-occurrence statistics, snapped to the nearest Golay codeword. The Golay code is a perfect error-correcting code — it can correct up to 3 errors in 24 bits. This means:

- **Hamming distance = semantic distance** (words close in Hamming space are semantically related)
- **NRCI = stability** (words at stable lattice positions have high NRCI)
- **Quadrant weights = grammatical role** (Reality→NOUN, Information→ADJECTIVE, Activation→VERB, Potential→OPERATOR)

### The Knowledge Graph (CRG)

The Concept Relation Graph has 930+ curated semantic edges connecting physics, math, and UBP concepts. Each edge is a labeled relationship like `("hamiltonian", "generates", "time")` or `("entropy", "measures", "dimension")`.

### Three Column Thinking

Every response is structured as aligned thought steps:

```
Step 1: DEFINITION
  Language: Gravity is a fundamental force arising from spacetime curvature.
  Math:     NRCI(gravity) = 0.6814, HW = 12
  Script:   entry = vocab['gravity']; nrci = float(entry.nrci)

Step 2: RELATIONSHIPS
  Language: Gravity curves spacetime. Gravity attracts mass.
  Math:     gravity --curves--> spacetime ∧ gravity --attracts--> mass
  Script:   edges = crg.out.get('gravity', [])

Step 3: GEOMETRY
  Language: Gravity occupies the Potential layer with 4 bits.
  Math:     v(gravity) = 0x4C68BD, Q = [3,2,2,5]
  Script:   v = vocab['gravity'].vector

Step 4: IMPLICATIONS
  Language: Gravity curves spacetime. Spacetime contains event.
  Math:     chain: gravity → spacetime → event

Step 5: RESOLUTION
  All columns align: gravity is well-defined and coherent.
```

The `chat()` method shows only the Language column. The `chat_verbose()` method shows all three.

### On-the-Fly Learning

Feed the GLM any text and it grows:

```python
rt.learn("The Standard Model describes three of the four known fundamental forces.")
# → Learns vocabulary, definitions, CRG edges, and co-occurrence patterns
```

Every text is training data. Every conversation makes it smarter.

### Geometric Realignment

The GLM's knowledge graph is a physical system. Concepts have positions in 3D space (quadrant weights). Edges are springs connecting related concepts. Coherence is physical stability.

At boot, the GLM runs geometric realignment — moving semantically close concepts to be geometrically close in the substrate. This improves coherence.

## What Makes This Novel

1. **Deterministic** — Same input always produces same output. No sampling, no temperature.
2. **Geometry-grounded** — Every word has a 24-bit Golay codeword. Hamming distance = semantic distance.
3. **Three Column Thinking** — Language, math, and code must align at every step.
4. **Learns in real-time** — Feed it text and it grows vocabulary, definitions, edges.
5. **Physical knowledge graph** — Concepts have positions, edges are springs, coherence is stability.
6. **Real math** — SymPy evaluation, native ALU, Golay error correction.

---

## Sandbox & Persistence (v4.1)

### Virtual Thinking Environment
The GLM has a sandbox where it can execute code safely:

```python
result = rt.sandbox_think("""
v = vocab['gravity'].vector
q = [sum(v[0:6]), sum(v[6:12]), sum(v[12:18]), sum(v[18:24])]
observe('gravity_quadrants', str(q))
print(f'Quadrants: {q}')
""")
```

**Loop prevention:**
- Max 20 iterations per thought
- Max 50 operations per query
- 5-second timeout per operation
- Recursion depth limit: 5

### Persistent Memory
Everything persists across sessions:

```python
rt.sandbox_observe("key", "value")  # Store
rt.sandbox_recall("key")            # Recall
rt.sandbox_recall()                  # Get all context
```

**What persists:**
- Learned vocabulary (words, definitions, vectors)
- Learned CRG edges
- Observations and insights
- Session history
- Growth log

### Growth Tracking
The GLM tracks its own growth:

```python
status = rt.status()
# → {vocab_size, crg_edges, sandbox: {observations, thoughts}, persistence: {learned_vocab, ...}}
```
