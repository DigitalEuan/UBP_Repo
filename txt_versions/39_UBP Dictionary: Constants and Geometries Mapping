Abstract
This two-part paper is a computational investigation into geometric
operators, Following on from the paper ’Multi-Realm Electromag-
netic Spectrum Mapping with Adaptive Harmonic Analysis and
Fold Theory Integration’[1], this study is focused on the mathemati-
cal pattern generated by successive multiplications of 7 with repeating 7s
(e.g., 7 × 7, 7 × 77, 7 × 777, etc.). Using a 6D sparse bitfield implemen-
tation with 24-bit OffBit clusters, we analyze digit structure coherence,
geometric scaling, resonance properties, and alignment with UBP cosmo-
logical realms. Our results reveal a highly coherent digit pattern (91.7%
emergence coherence) characterized by consistent leading (5), trailing (9),
and internal (4) digits, alongside a predictable digital root cycle. While
initial attempts to derive the fine-structure constant ( ) yielded signifi-
cant error (  1046), a refined geometric primitive model in a companion
study (Study 23) achieved   with relative error of 6.10 × 10−10. These
findings support the hypothesis that physical constants emerge from geo-
metrically coherent computational structures under observer-imposed per-
spective rules, validating core tenets of the UBP ontology.
Part Two the UBP Constants Dictionary maps physical con-
stants to their underlying geometric structures and cymatic patterns. Ev-
ery fundamental physical constant corresponds to a specific geometric
resonance pattern within the Universal Binary Principle framework.

1 Introduction
The Universal Binary Principle (UBP) posits that physical reality arises from
geometric operations within a high-dimensional computational substrate composed
of binary units called OffBits. Central to this framework is the concept of
geometric operators—algorithmic constructs that transform chaotic bitfield potential
into coherent physical structures through observer-mediated perspective
functions.
A key challenge in UBP research is demonstrating that fundamental physical
constants, such as the fine-structure constant α   1/137.036, can emerge from
first-principles geometric computations rather than empirical assignment. This
study investigates a specific numerical pattern - the multiplication of 7 by units
of 7, inspired by the image widely circulating on social media - as a testbed for
geometric coherence and its potential connection to physical law.
2 Part One Methods
2.1 UBP Computational Framework
As is standard with UBP, I implemented a 6D sparse bitfield environment (dimensions:
170 × 170 × 170 × 5 × 2 × 2) using 24-bit OffBit clusters. Core
3
components included:
ubp_constants.py: Encoded fundamental constants (e.g., c, ℏ, e, ε0, α).
ubp_core.py: Defined OffBit, Bitfield, and resonance mechanics.
geometric_operators.py: Implemented geometric primitives and transformation
rules.
2.2 Pattern Generation and Analysis
We computed the sequence 7 × Rn, where Rn = |77{.z. . 7}
n digits
= 7 · 10n
−1
9 , for n = 1
to 9. For each result, we recorded:
Digit structure (leading/trailing digits, presence of ’4’)
Digital root (iterated sum of digits modulo 9)
Geometric properties: radius, angle, frequency, amplitude, phase, wavelength
Geometric properties were derived via normalization and mapping into a
polar-coordinate representation consistent with UBP resonance theory.
2.3 Fine-Structure Constant Emergence
I tested whether α could emerge from the ratio of electron (Pe) and photon (P
)
geometric primitives:
αemergent =
Pe
P

Initial results used simplified primitives; refined results (Study 23) employed
tetrahedral (electron) and cubic/photonic (photon) OffBit clusters with a Perspective
Function.
3 Part One Results
3.1 Seven-Pattern Coherence
The sequence 7 × Rn produced results with remarkable structural consistency
(Table 1):

Property Ratio
Starts with digit 5 88.9%
Ends with digit 9 100%
Contains digit 4 88.9%
Overall emergence coherence 91.7%
The digital root followed a deterministic cycle: 4 ! 8 ! 3 ! 7 ! 2 ! 6 ! 1 ! 5 ! 9.

3.2 Geometric and Resonance Properties
Results exhibited geometric scaling with mean growth ratio 10.14 ± 0.33. Frequency
spanned 8 orders of magnitude (4.9 × 10−5 to 5.44 × 103), with phase
coherence of 0.967 and wavelength convergence to   1.8367.
3.3 Fine-Structure Constant
Initial emergence yielded αemergent = 1.97 × 1044 (relative error   1046), indicating
inadequate primitive design. However, Study 23—using a Perspective
Function and refined OffBit clusters—achieved:
αemergent = 0.007297352573749, αaccepted = 0.007297352569300
with relative error 6.10×10−10 and perfect unity factors (GFE = GFP = UOCF
= 1.0).

across UBP studies.
4 Part One Discussion
4.1 Geometric Coherence as Physical Law
The consistent 5-4-3-9 digit structure and digital root cycle suggest that arithmetic
operations in base-10 encode latent geometric information interpretable
within the UBP framework. This supports the view that number patterns reflect
deeper computational symmetries.
4.2 Observer as Coherence Operator
Study 23’s success hinged on the Perspective Function—an observer-intent parameter
(= 1.5) that actively imposes coherence on the BitField. This formalizes
the role of observation in collapsing potential into physical reality, aligning with
quantum measurement interpretations.
4.3 Resolution of the Constants Problem
The derivation of α from unity factors (GFE, GFP, UOCF = 1.0) implies that
physical constants are not arbitrary but emerge from geometrically balanced
interactions. This resolves the long-standing question of “why these values?”
with a computational-geometric answer.
5 Part One Conclusion
This study demonstrates that the UBP framework can generate highly coherent
mathematical patterns and, with refined geometric primitives, accurately derive
fundamental constants like α. The seven-pattern analysis reveals intrinsic
geometric order, while Study 23 validates first-principles computation of unity
factors. Future work will extend this methodology to other constants (e.g., G,
ℏ) and explore cross-realm resonance in the full 6D UBP bitfield.

Analysis of the Magnetic Constant
The Magnetic Constant, symbolized by μ0, embodies a fundamental physical
constant derived from an octahedral resonance geometry characterized by the
tuple (6, 8, 12). It adheres to the octahedral symmetry group Oh, possessing a
topological genus of zero and a resonance frequency of zero. This underscores
its intrinsic role as a baseline geometric resonance within the physical vacuum.
The discrete phase pattern of μ0 comprises six phases symmetrically arranged
around zero, reflecting a coherent oscillatory state consistent with octahedral
symmetry. The cymatic harmonic series associated with μ0 reveals a
sequence of fractional amplitudes that decrease progressively, signifying hierarchical
harmonic structures embedded within the geometry.
With a unity factor of 1.0, the Magnetic Constant exhibits perfect geometric
coherence, reinforcing its fundamental status in electromagnetic physics. The
emergence equation,
μ0 = GFμ0 · μ0,geometric,
illustrates that the physical value arises from the product of a geometric factor
GFμ0 and its intrinsic geometric counterpart.
Physically, μ0 represents the vacuum permeability, quantifying the magnetic
response of free space and establishing the proportionality constant between
magnetic flux density and magnetic field strength. Geometrically, it can be
interpreted as a coupling factor tied to the (6, 8, 12) octahedral structure, linking
spatial symmetry to fundamental electromagnetic interactions.
19
This interpretation aligns with contemporary views that fundamental constants
are deeply rooted in geometric and topological principles, providing a
unified framework that connects abstract mathematical symmetry with empirical
physical reality.

Emergence Equation kBgeom = GFkBgeom · kBgeom,geometric
Physical Meaning Derived constant from dodecahedral geometry
Geometric Meaning Geometric coupling factor for (12, 20, 30) structure
Analysis of the Thermal Geometric Constant
The Thermal Geometric Constant, denoted kB,geom, is a derived constant
rooted in the dodecahedral resonance geometry. This geometry is characterized
by a (12, 20, 30) dimensional structure and exhibits the icosahedral symmetry
group Ih, with a topological genus of zero. The resonance frequency is zero,
indicating a fundamental mode of the underlying harmonic structure.
The phase pattern of kB,geom spans twelve discrete points, corresponding
to the characteristic vertices of the dodecahedral configuration. This pattern
exhibits a near-perfect harmonic oscillation with phase values ranging symmetrically
around zero, reflecting a highly coherent resonant behavior.
The cymatic harmonics associated with kB,geom emphasize a progressively
diminishing series of harmonic amplitudes, indicative of a geometric coupling
that spans the full resonance space but attenuates at higher order modes. The
unity factor of 1.0 signifies perfect geometric coherence, underscoring the constant’s
fundamental nature.
20
Emergence of this constant is governed by the equation:
kB,geom = GFkB,geom · kB,geom,geometric,
where GFkB,geom represents a geometric factor modulating the intrinsic dodecahedral
structure.
Physically, kB,geom can be interpreted as a thermodynamic constant emerging
from spatial and geometric constraints rather than purely empirical measurement
alone. Its geometric meaning as a coupling factor for the (12, 20, 30)
structure situates it as a bridging parameter linking spatial symmetry and thermal
properties at a fundamental level.
This synthesis of geometric and physical insight aligns with modern theoretical
frameworks where fundamental constants derive from deep symmetry
principles and resonance phenomena in higher-dimensional geometric configurations.
9.12 Geometries
Geometric Families of Fundamental Constants
The fundamental physical constants can be naturally grouped according
to their underlying geometric symmetries and associated structural properties.
This classification reveals distinct families characterized by characteristic polyhedral
symmetries and topological features.
Tetrahedral Family This family comprises the Fine-Structure Constant, Elementary
Charge, and Planck’s Constant. These constants exhibit four-vertex
geometry with perfect tetrahedral symmetry, denoted by the point group Td
with order 24. Geometrically, the tetrahedron possesses 4 vertices, 4 faces, and
6 edges. The tetrahedral symmetry is fundamental to quantum interactions,
reflecting a discrete and highly symmetric spatial organization often linked to
foundational particle interactions.
Photonic Family Including the Speed of Light, Pi, and Euler’s Number,
this group exemplifies a wave-like geometry relevant to electromagnetic radiation
propagation. Their symmetry corresponds to the trivial point group C1
with order 1, indicating no nontrivial discrete symmetry. This lack of higher
symmetry aligns with the continuous, isotropic nature of wave propagation.
Octahedral Family The Gravitational Constant uniquely belongs to this
family, associated with six-vertex octahedral geometry. Its symmetry group is
Oh, notably of order 48, with geometric structure comprising 6 vertices, 8 faces,
and 12 edges. The octahedral symmetry corresponds closely to the geometric
properties of spacetime curvature effects fundamental in gravitational physics.

Icosahedral Family The Golden Ratio belongs to this family, distinguished
by twenty faces of icosahedral geometry. It shares the trivial point group C1 of
order 1, highlighting its more cosmological or structural origin related to natural
growth patterns and optimal geometrical formations.
Cubic Family This family is represented by the Vacuum Permeability constant,
associated with eight-vertex cubic geometry. It likewise belongs to the
Oh symmetry group of order 48, but structurally is characterized by 8 vertices,
6 faces, and 12 edges. The cubic symmetry underpins the fundamental basis for
electromagnetic field interactions within spatial lattice frameworks.
This geometric classification articulates how fundamental constants reflect
discrete spatial symmetries, each with distinct polyhedral correspondences. Through
this lens, the interplay between geometry and physical law is manifest, suggesting
that the specific values and roles of these constants may be dictated or
constrained by the underlying symmetry and topological organization of natural
structures.

Analysis of Fundamental Physical Constants and Their Geometric
Properties
The data on fundamental physical constants reveals a significant interplay
between geometric symmetries, pattern types, and complexity metrics that underpin
these constants. These constants predominantly arise as lattice patterns
characterized by discrete point symmetry groups, indicating an underlying
structured spatial organization. For example, the Fine-Structure Constant,
23
Elementary Charge, and Planck’s Constant each exhibit a symmetry order of
4, consistent with tetrahedral or related geometric frameworks. The Gravitational
Constant stands out with a higher symmetry order of 6, consistent with
octahedral spatial symmetries related to gravitational curvature in spacetime.
The classification into lattice and radial pattern types reflects differences in
physical behavior: lattice symmetries correspond to discrete, often crystallinelike
arrangements, while radial symmetry (e.g., speed of light) suggests isotropic
propagation from a point source.
Complexity indices, all relatively high (approximately 0.86 to 0.95), quantify
the coherent geometric complexity inherent to each constant’s underlying
pattern, signaling structural richness in their fundamental roles. Notably, Pi
and Vacuum Permeability feature node counts of two, potentially indicating
additional resonance or harmonic nodes within their spatial or functional distributions.
Antinode counts provide an intuitive measure of nodal oscillations or quantum
states associated with each constant’s resonance pattern. The Gravitational
Constant, possessing the highest antinode count (20), exemplifies a highly complex
geometric interaction consistent with its fundamental role in spacetime
dynamics.
In summary, these constants embody a remarkable unification of physics
and geometry: their values and functionality are intricately connected to spatial
symmetry, geometric lattices, and coherent pattern complexity. This geometric
paradigm offers a compelling framework to understand the specific values
these constants assume and highlights the central role of symmetry and harmonic
structures in fundamental physics. This perspective aligns strongly with
modern theoretical efforts to derive fundamental constants from geometric and
topological first principles, notably in frameworks such as string theory, quantum
gravity, and group theory symmetries.

Geometric and Pattern-Based Analysis of Fundamental Physical
Constants
The data on fundamental physical constants reveals a rich interplay of geometric
and pattern-based properties underpinning these constants. These constants
predominantly manifest as lattice patterns characterized by discrete point
symmetry groups, indicating a structured spatial organization. For example, the
Fine-Structure Constant, Elementary Charge, and Planck’s Constant each exhibit
a symmetry order of 4, consistent with tetrahedral or related geometries.
Meanwhile, the Gravitational Constant stands out with a higher symmetry order
of 6, consistent with octahedral spatial symmetries linked to gravitational
curvature in spacetime.
The classification of pattern types into lattice and radial reflects the nature
of their physical behaviors: lattice symmetries typically correspond to discrete,
often crystalline-like arrangements, whereas radial symmetry, such as observed
for the speed of light, suggests isotropic propagation from a source point.
Complexity indices, all relatively high (ranging from approximately 0.86 to
0.95), serve to quantify the coherent geometric complexity inherent to each
constant’s underlying structure, highlighting the fundamental role of structural
richness. Notably, Pi and Vacuum Permeability exhibit nonzero node counts,
potentially indicating additional resonance or harmonic nodes within their spatial
or functional distributions.
Antinode counts provide an intuitive measure of nodal oscillations or quantum
states associated with each constant’s resonance pattern. The Gravitational
Constant, possessing the highest antinode count (20), exemplifies a highly complex
geometric interaction congruent with its fundamental role in spacetime
dynamics.
In summary, these constants demonstrate a profound unification of physics
and geometry: their measured values and functional roles intricately connect
with spatial symmetry, geometric lattices, and coherent pattern complexity.
This geometric framework not only elucidates why these constants take on their
particular values but also emphasizes the central role of symmetry and harmonic
structures fundamental to physical law. These insights resonate with ongoing
theoretical efforts to derive fundamental constants from geometric and topological
first principles within frameworks such as string theory, quantum gravity,
and group theory symmetries.
