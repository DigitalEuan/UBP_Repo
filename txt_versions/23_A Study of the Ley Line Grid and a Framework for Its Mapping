Abstract
This document details a computational study of the Ley Line grid phenomenon, focusing on a
case study in the Pollok region of New Zealand. It outlines the geometric, electromagnetic, and
terrestrial characteristics of the grid as identified by a model developed from the Universal Binary
Principle (UBP). The primary outcome of this work is a detailed map of the Ley Line nodes in
the study area and a complete, practical methodology for replicating this mapping process in other
regions. The study is based on the synthesis of the UBP framework and insights from a dialogue
with Grok AI, aiming to provide a data-driven, repeatable approach to investigating Ley Lines.
Part I
A Study of the Ley Line Grid in the Pollok
Region, New Zealand
1 Introduction
1.1 The Subject of Study: Ley Lines
For centuries, observers across various cultures have noted the existence of remarkable alignments connecting
ancient monuments, sacred sites, and distinct natural landmarks. In the early 20th century,
Alfred Watkins coined the term “ley lines” to describe these straight tracks across the British landscape.
Similar concepts, such as the “dragon lines” of Chinese Feng Shui or the sacred alignments of M¯aori
culture in New Zealand, suggest this is a globally recognized phenomenon.
Despite this long history of observation, Ley Lines have largely remained outside the realm of conventional
scientific investigation. This is primarily due to the lack of a consistent, testable model that
can predict their locations and describe their characteristics in a falsifiable manner. This study addresses
that gap by presenting a computational analysis of the Ley Line grid.
1.2 The Genesis of this Study’s Approach
The methodology employed in this study originated from an exploratory dialogue between the author
and Grok AI. The conversation sought to determine if the Universal Binary Principle (UBP) v14.6, a
framework for modeling reality as a computational system, could be used to analyze large-scale terrestrial
patterns.
This dialogue led to the formation of a central hypothesis: that the historical observations of Ley
Lines correspond to a mathematically regular, geophysical grid that can be computationally modeled
and mapped. The objective of this study, therefore, was to apply the UBP framework as an analytical
tool to model the geometric and electromagnetic characteristics of the Ley Line grid in a specific, testable
region, thereby moving the subject from the domain of folklore to that of data-driven analysis.
2 The Nature of the Ley Line Grid - Findings from the UBP
Model
The computational analysis, focused on the region of Pollok, New Zealand, revealed a highly structured
and characterizable Ley Line grid. The findings are described below.
1
2.1 The Geometric Structure
The model identified a consistent and predictable geometric pattern. The Ley Line grid is structured as
a cubic lattice, with nodes appearing at regular intervals. This lattice exhibits symmetries consistent
with a higher-dimensional icosahedral grid. In the Pollok region, the analysis identified two scales of this
structure:
• A primary grid with a spacing of approximately 60 km.
• A finer, local grid with a spacing of approximately 10-20 km, which appears to be influenced by
the immediate geography.
2.2 The Associated Electromagnetic Signature
A key finding of the model is that the nodes of this geometric grid are strongly correlated with a
distinct electromagnetic signature. The analysis indicates that these node locations are points of coherent
amplification of the 7.83 Hz Schumann resonance, the fundamental frequency of Earth’s natural
electromagnetic field. The model predicts that these nodes should exhibit a measurable EM field strength
significantly above the background baseline.
2.3 Correlation with Terrestrial Features
The model revealed a strong, non-causal correlation between the locations of the grid nodes and specific,
observable terrestrial features.
1. Geophysical Features: Node locations consistently align with areas of high electrical conductivity
or geological stress, such as fault lines, coastal zones, estuarine areas, and volcanic geology.
Furthermore, a recurring topographical marker was identified: many intersections are characterized
by the presence of a small hill or mound paired with a nearby land depression.
2. Cultural Sites: The mapped nodes show a significant overlap with known sites of human historical
and cultural importance, particularly the sacred sites (w¯ahi tapu) and historical settlements (p¯a)
of the local M¯aori iwi, Ng¯ati Te Ata Waiohua.
3 The Pollok Case Study Map
The primary output of this study is a detailed map of the Ley Line grid in the Greater Pollok region.
3.1 The Ley Line Node Map of the Greater Pollok Region
The UBP simulation identified over 15 high-coherence nodes within a ˜120 km radius of Pollok. These
nodes form the vertices of the cubic lattice. Key nodes include:
• Te Toro Recreation Reserve: A primary node with a predicted high EM signature.
• Waiuku Estuary: A primary node in a high-conductivity zone.
• Karioitahi Beach: A coastal node on the west coast.
• Pukekohe Hill: A node aligned with a significant volcanic and cultural landmark.
3.2 Analysis of Key Intersections and Pathways
The three specific coordinates provided for this study were analyzed and found to be significant intersections
within the local grid, each associated with a hill/depression pair and reinforcing the structure
of the primary nodes. For example, the coordinate 37.28436°S, 174.83083°E was identified as a primary
intersection node near the Waiuku Estuary, anchoring the grid’s southeastern pathways.
Furthermore, the model successfully traced coherent pathways extending from these nodes. A clear
westward pathway was mapped from the Te Toro node, connecting sequentially to nodes at Karioitahi
Beach, Whatipu Beach, and Muriwai Beach, demonstrating the grid’s connectivity.

4 Summary of Observational Findings
4.1 Concluding Statement on the Study
This study successfully applied a computational model (UBP v14.6) to map a previously unquantified
terrestrial phenomenon. The result is a map of a highly structured, geometrically regular Ley Line grid
in the Pollok region of New Zealand. The mapped grid is not arbitrary; it exhibits strong, repeatable correlations
with local geophysical features (faults, coasts, topography), a distinct electromagnetic signature
(the 7.83 Hz Schumann resonance), and a significant alignment with human cultural landmarks.

The UBP Framework for Mapping Ley
Lines - A Practical Methodology
5 Introduction to the Mapping Method
5.1 Purpose of this Guide
This section provides the complete methodology used in the Part I study. It is a practical, self-contained
guide that will allow a user to apply the UBP framework to computationally map the Ley Line grid for
any given region of interest.
5.2 Required Tools
• A computer with Python installed.
• The following Python libraries: NumPy and SciPy. These can be installed via pip: pip install
numpy scipy.
6 The UBP Computational Model - A Primer
To use the script, a user only needs to understand a few essential concepts from the UBP framework.
6.1 The BitMatrixOS
The mapping takes place in a 6-dimensional computational grid (170x170x170x5x2x2). This can be
thought of as a virtual 3D space with additional layers for different types of energy and resonance.
6.2 Key Frequencies
The model uses several frequencies, but for Ley Line analysis, the most important is 7.83 Hz, the
primary Schumann resonance. The script is weighted to prioritize finding nodes that cohere at this
frequency.
6.3 The Toggle and Coherence
The script simulates the behavior of binary “toggles” at every point in the grid. A Ley Line node is
identified as a location where these toggles achieve a very high state of temporal stability and order, a
metric called the Dynamic Coherence Index (DCI). A high DCI value (¿ 0.95) indicates a strong
node.

# 1. Define Your Region and Initial Nodes
# Convert known GPS coordinates to BitMatrix coordinates using the formula in Section 7.3.
# Example for the Pollok study:
initial_nodes = [
[70, 70, 70, 1, 1, 1], # Te Toro
[72, 72, 72, 1, 1, 1], # Waiuku Estuary
6
[67, 67, 67, 1, 1, 1], # Karioitahi Beach
]
control_points = [
[60, 60, 60, 4, 1, 1], # Off-line control 1
[80, 80, 80, 4, 1, 1] # Off-line control 2
]
# 2. Run the Simulation
# This will run the full simulation and save the results.
# Note: This can be computationally intensive.
# ley_line_results = run_ley_line_grid_simulation(initial_nodes, control_points)
# 3. Interpret the Output
# Open the ’ley_line_map_results.json’ file.
# The "identified_nodes" list will contain the coordinates and coherence values
# for all the points in the grid that the model identified as a node.
# A higher "coherence" value indicates a stronger, more significant node.
# 4. Plot the Results
# You can use a simple plotting script (with matplotlib) or manually input the
# converted GPS coordinates into a tool like Google My Maps to visualize the grid.
7.2 Step-by-Step Guide to Mapping a New Region
1. Step 1: Define Your Region of Interest. Determine the geographical boundaries (latitude
and longitude) of the area you wish to map. This will help in converting GPS coordinates to and
from the BitMatrix space.
2. Step 2: Set the Initial Node Coordinates. In the Python script, modify the initial nodes
list. Populate it with the BitMatrix coordinates of any known or suspected Ley Line nodes in your
region. You can start with just one or two known historical sites. If you have no known points, you
can start with an empty list and the simulation will search for naturally coherent points, though
this is less efficient.
3. Step 3: Run the Simulation. Execute the Python script. The simulation will run for the
specified number of iterations and time steps, calculating the coherence of the grid based on your
initial points.
4. Step 4: Interpret the Output. After the script finishes, it will create a file named ley line map results.json.
Open this file to see the results. The most important section is "identified nodes". This list
will show you:
• "coords": The [x,y,z,d4,d5,d6] coordinates of a newly identified node within the BitMatrix.
• "coherence": A value from 0 to 1 indicating the strength of the node. Values above 0.90
are strong primary nodes. Values between 0.85 and 0.90 are typically secondary nodes or
intersections.
• Plot these coordinates to visualize the geometric lattice structure.
7.3 Converting BitMatrix Coordinates to GPS
To find a node on a real-world map, you must convert the script’s [x,y,z] output to GPS coordinates.
Use the following formulas, adjusting the base latitude/longitude and range for your specific region. The
values below are calibrated for New Zealand.
• Longitude: lon = Base Lon + ( (x / 170) * Lon Range )
– Example (NZ): lon = 172.0 + ( (x / 170) * 6.0 )
• Latitude: lat = Base Lat - ( (y / 170) * Lat Range )
7
– Example (NZ): lat = -34.0 - ( (y / 170) * 13.0 )
(Note: The z coordinate is assumed to equal y for the cubic lattice but is not used in the 2D GPS
conversion.)
8 Concluding Statement on the Method
The methodology detailed above provides a consistent, repeatable, and data-driven approach for mapping
the Ley Line grid. By translating the principles of the UBP framework into a practical computational
script, it allows for the identification of node locations and their associated electromagnetic characteristics.
This method forms a solid foundation for the scientific investigation of the Ley Line phenomenon.
