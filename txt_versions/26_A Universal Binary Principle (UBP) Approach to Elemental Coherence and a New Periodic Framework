Abstract
The conventional periodic table of elements, while foundational to chemistry, is
predicated on atomic number and electron shell configurations. This paper presents
an alternative framework for understanding elemental relationships based on the
Universal Binary Principle (UBP), a theoretical model that posits reality as a
computational system governed by resonance and coherence. We introduce the Core
Resonance Value (CRV) as a fundamental frequency for each element and the Non-
Random Coherence Index (NRCI) as a measure of their resonant interaction. Through a
series of computational experiments, we first demonstrate that a periodic table based
on simple integer doubling, as proposed by Terrence Howard, exhibits low coherence
(mean NRCI = -􏚱.􏚲􏚸􏚷􏚹) within the UBP framework. In contrast, a UBP-derived model
based on CRVs scaled by fundamental mathematical constants (φ, e, √􏚳) achieves a
significantly higher mean NRCI of 􏚱.􏚺􏚸􏚹􏚹. Expanding this analysis to all 􏚲􏚲􏚹 known
elements and 􏚳􏚵 hypothetical superheavy elements, we identify a complex “Resonant
Network” of elemental interactions, with a global mean pairwise NRCI of 􏚱.􏚺􏚺􏚱􏚹. This
network structure, which deviates significantly from the standard periodic table,
reveals “Coherence Hubs” and “Stability Islands” that are not apparent in the
traditional model. We propose a new periodic framework organized not as a 􏚳D grid
but as a multi-dimensional coherence landscape, where elements are grouped by their
CRV family and positioned based on their NRCI. This UBP-based model offers a new
lens for interpreting elemental properties and predicts the existence and
characteristics of new, stable superheavy elements, suggesting that resonance, not
just atomic number, is a fundamental organizing principle of matter.
􏚲. Introduction
The periodic table of elements is one of the most significant achievements in modern
science, providing a systematic classification of the chemical elements based on their
atomic structure and properties. The current model, arranged by atomic number (the
number of protons in an atom's nucleus) and electron configurations, has been
remarkably successful in predicting the chemical behavior of elements and the
existence of new ones. However, this framework, while powerful, is largely empirical,
derived from observed chemical properties and quantum mechanical models of the
atom. It does not fully account for the deeper, underlying principles that might govern
the stability and interaction of elements from a more fundamental, energetic
perspective.
This paper explores an alternative paradigm for understanding the organization of the
elements, based on the Universal Binary Principle (UBP). The UBP is a theoretical
framework that models the universe as a deterministic, computational system. In this
model, all physical phenomena, including the properties of matter, emerge from the
interactions of binary states, or “toggles,” within a multi-dimensional computational
matrix. The UBP posits that the stability and relationships between elements are not
solely a function of their constituent particles (protons, neutrons, and electrons) but
are instead governed by principles of resonance and coherence. The central
hypothesis of this work is that the elements form a “Resonant Network,” where their
properties and interactions are determined by their fundamental frequencies and their
ability to form coherent, resonant structures.
To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce two key concepts derived from the UBP
framework: the Core Resonance Value (CRV) and the Non-Random Coherence Index
(NRCI). The CRV represents the fundamental resonant frequency of an element, a
value that is not directly equivalent to its atomic mass or number but is instead a
measure of its intrinsic energetic signature within the UBP’s computational
substrate. The NRCI, in turn, is a metric designed to quantify the degree of coherence
between the resonant patterns of two or more elements. An NRCI value close to 􏚲.􏚱
indicates a highly coherent, stable, and non-random relationship, while a value close
to 􏚱 or below suggests a lack of coherence or a random, unstable interaction.
Our research begins by examining an alternative periodic table model proposed by
Terrence Howard, which organizes the elements based on a pattern of doubling
(powers of 􏚳). We test this model within the UBP framework by assigning CRVs to
Howard’s proposed elements and calculating their pairwise NRCI. This initial test
serves as a crucial baseline, allowing us to evaluate whether a simple arithmetic
progression can account for elemental coherence as defined by the UBP.
Following this initial analysis, we develop a new model for the periodic table based on
UBP principles. Instead of simple doubling, we propose that the CRVs of the elements
are scaled by fundamental mathematical constants, such as the golden ratio (φ),
Euler’s number (e), and the square root of 􏚳 (√􏚳). We hypothesize that these
constants, which are ubiquitous in nature and fundamental to geometry and growth
patterns, also govern the harmonic relationships between the elements. We test this
hypothesis by constructing a UBP-based periodic table and comparing its coherence to
both the standard model and Howard’s theory.
Finally, we extend our analysis to all 􏚲􏚲􏚹 known elements, as well as 􏚳􏚵 hypothetical
superheavy elements, to create a comprehensive “Coherence Landscape” of the
elements. This landscape is not a simple two-dimensional grid but a complex, multidimensional
network of resonant interactions. By analyzing this network, we identify
“Coherence Hubs” (elements with high overall coherence) and “Stability Islands”
(clusters of highly coherent elements), and we propose a new periodic framework
based on these findings. This new framework organizes the elements by their CRV
family and their position within the resonant network, offering a new perspective on
the fundamental principles that govern the structure of matter.
This paper presents the methodology, results, and implications of this research,
arguing that a resonance-based model, as described by the UBP, can provide a deeper
and more predictive understanding of the periodic table of elements.
􏚳. Methods
The theoretical framework and computational methodology underpinning this study
are derived from the Universal Binary Principle (UBP), a deterministic model that
describes reality as a 􏚷-dimensional (and scalable to 􏚳􏚵-dimensional) computational
system. This section details the core concepts of the UBP, the metrics used to quantify
elemental coherence, and the computational experiments performed.
􏚳.􏚲 The Universal Binary Principle (UBP) Framework
The UBP framework posits that all physical phenomena emerge from the interactions
of binary states, or “toggles,” within a vast, multi-dimensional Bitfield. These
toggles are not merely abstract bits of information but are the fundamental
constituents of reality, and their interactions are governed by a set of deterministic
rules. The geometry of this interaction space is defined by the Triad Graph Interaction
Constraint (TGIC), which enforces a specific 􏚴, 􏚷, 􏚺 structure (􏚴 axes, 􏚷 faces, 􏚺
interactions per toggle), creating a highly structured and interconnected network.
Within the UBP, each element is modeled not as a collection of subatomic particles in
the conventional sense, but as a complex, resonant system defined by its unique
signature within the Bitfield. This signature is characterized by the element’s Core
Resonance Value (CRV).
􏚳.􏚳 Core Resonance Value (CRV)
The CRV is the foundational metric in our analysis. It represents the fundamental
frequency or resonant signature of an element within the UBP’s computational
matrix. The CRV is not directly derived from an element’s atomic mass or number but
is instead calculated based on its relationship to a set of fundamental constants that
are hypothesized to govern resonance in the UBP. In this study, the CRVs for the
elements are determined by scaling a base frequency by a set of multipliers derived
from fundamental mathematical constants. The initial set of CRV families used in this
research includes:
Base: The fundamental frequency, unscaled.
Phi (φ): Scaled by the golden ratio (approximately 􏚲.􏚷􏚲􏚹).
Euler (e): Scaled by Euler’s number (approximately 􏚳.􏚸􏚲􏚹).
Sqrt(􏚳): Scaled by the square root of 􏚳 (approximately 􏚲.􏚵􏚲􏚵).
As the research progressed, these families were refined and expanded to include
higher-order terms (e.g., phi_squared , phi_cubed ) and additional roots ( sqrt3 ,
sqrt5 ), allowing for a more nuanced and accurate mapping of elemental resonance.
􏚳.􏚴 Non-Random Coherence Index (NRCI)
To quantify the coherence of the resonant interactions between elements, we
developed the Non-Random Coherence Index (NRCI). The NRCI is a statistical measure
that compares the observed resonant interaction between two elements to a baseline
of random, non-coherent interaction. It is calculated using the following formula:
NRCI = 1 - (sqrt(sum((S_i - T_i)^2) / n) / sigma(T))
Where:
S_i is the simulated resonant signal at time i .
T_i is the theoretical target signal at time i .
n is the number of samples.
sigma(T) is the standard deviation of the target signal.
A perfect NRCI of 􏚲.􏚱 indicates that the simulated interaction perfectly matches the
theoretical coherent waveform, signifying a completely stable and non-random
resonant bond. An NRCI of 􏚱 indicates that the interaction is no more coherent than a
random signal, and a negative NRCI suggests a chaotic or anti-coherent relationship.
􏚳.􏚵 Computational Experiments
Our study was conducted in a series of computational experiments, each designed to
test a specific hypothesis about elemental coherence.
􏚲. Validation of Terrence Howard’s Periodic Table: We first modeled Terrence
Howard’s proposed periodic table, which is based on a simple doubling of a
base value (powers of 􏚳). We assigned CRVs to the elements in this model and
computed the pairwise NRCI for all elements in the set. This experiment was
designed to determine if a simple arithmetic progression could produce a
coherent system within the UBP framework.
􏚳. Development of the UBP Resonant Pairs Model: Next, we developed a
contrasting model based on UBP principles. In this model, the CRVs of the
elements were scaled by the fundamental constants (φ, e, √􏚳). We then
calculated the pairwise NRCI for this set of “Resonant Pairs” to determine if a
system based on these harmonic relationships would exhibit higher coherence.
􏚴. Full Periodic Table Analysis: The analysis was then extended to all 􏚲􏚲􏚹 known
elements. Each element was assigned a CRV based on the refined set of CRV
families. A complete 􏚲􏚲􏚹x􏚲􏚲􏚹 pairwise NRCI matrix was computed, and the
average NRCI for each element was calculated. This allowed us to create a
“Coherence Landscape” of the elements and identify “Coherence Hubs” ‒
elements with the highest average NRCI.
􏚵. Refinement and Prediction: Based on the results of the full table analysis, the
CRV scaling rules were further refined to better match the observed coherence
patterns. This refined model was then used to predict the CRVs and NRCIs of 􏚳􏚵
hypothetical superheavy elements. The entire analysis was then re-run with the
expanded set of 􏚲􏚵􏚳 elements (􏚲􏚲􏚹 real and 􏚳􏚵 hypothetical) to produce the final,
refined Resonant Network.
All simulations were performed using a custom-built UBP simulation environment.
The results of each experiment were logged, and the key findings were visualized using
a variety of plotting techniques to reveal the underlying structure of the resonant
network.
􏚴. Results
This section presents the results of the computational experiments, following the
progression from the initial validation of Terrence Howard’s model to the
development of the final, refined UBP Resonant Network.
􏚴.􏚲 Analysis of Terrence Howard’s Periodic Table Model
Our first computational experiment was to evaluate the coherence of a periodic table
model based on powers of 􏚳, as proposed by Terrence Howard. The UBP simulation of
this model, which included seven elements with CRVs determined by a simple
doubling progression, yielded a mean NRCI of -􏚱.􏚲􏚸􏚷􏚹 with a standard deviation of
􏚱.􏚱􏚴􏚲􏚷. The individual NRCIs for the elements in this model were all negative, ranging
from -􏚱.􏚲􏚱􏚵 to -􏚱.􏚳􏚱􏚵. This result, as detailed in the terry_howard_ubp_results.txt
file, indicates a system with very low coherence, suggesting that a simple arithmetic
progression of CRVs is not sufficient to create a stable, resonant system within the UBP
framework. The negative NRCI values point to a chaotic and anti-coherent relationship
between the elements in this model, which is inconsistent with the principles of UBP.
􏚴.􏚳 UBP Resonant Pairs Model vs. Howard’s Model
To provide a direct contrast, we developed a “Resonant Pairs” model based on UBP
principles, where the CRVs of the elements were scaled by fundamental mathematical
constants (φ, e, √􏚳). When we simulated this model, the results were dramatically
different. The UBP Resonant Pairs model achieved a mean NRCI of 􏚱.􏚺􏚸􏚹􏚹. This stark
contrast is visualized in Figure 􏚶 ( 1000004896.png )
, which shows the Howard model’s NRCIs clustered in the negative range, while the
UBP model’s NRCIs are all close to 􏚲.􏚱. This finding provides strong evidence for our
hypothesis that elemental coherence is not based on simple arithmetic progressions
but on harmonic relationships derived from fundamental mathematical constants.
􏚴.􏚴 Full Periodic Table Analysis and the Identification of Coherence
Hubs
We then extended our analysis to all 􏚲􏚲􏚹 known elements, assigning a CRV to each
based on our initial set of CRV families. The pairwise NRCI was calculated for all 􏚲􏚲􏚹
elements, resulting in a comprehensive 􏚲􏚲􏚹x􏚲􏚲􏚹 coherence matrix. The global mean
pairwise NRCI for this initial full table analysis was 􏚱.􏚺􏚳􏚹􏚷. The distribution of the
average NRCI across the 􏚲􏚲􏚹 elements is shown in Figure 􏚵 ( 1000004899.png )
.
This analysis revealed that coherence is not uniformly distributed across the periodic
table. Instead, certain elements emerged as “Coherence Hubs,” with significantly
higher average NRCI values than their peers. The top 􏚲􏚱 Coherence Hubs from this
initial analysis were:
􏚲. Astatine (Z=􏚹􏚶), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚸􏚲􏚱
􏚳. Calcium (Z=􏚳􏚱), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚷􏚺􏚳
􏚴. Thorium (Z=􏚺􏚱), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚷􏚷􏚶
􏚵. Molybdenum (Z=􏚵􏚳), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚷􏚶􏚸
􏚶. Nobelium (Z=􏚲􏚱􏚳), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚷􏚶􏚲
􏚷. Indium (Z=􏚵􏚺), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚷􏚴􏚴
􏚸. Sulfur (Z=􏚲􏚷), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚷􏚴􏚲
􏚹. Rubidium (Z=􏚴􏚸), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚷􏚲􏚷
􏚺. Oganesson (Z=􏚲􏚲􏚹), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚶􏚺􏚵
􏚲􏚱. Actinium (Z=􏚹􏚺), Avg NRCI: 􏚱.􏚺􏚶􏚹􏚴
These hubs, which include elements from various groups and periods of the standard
periodic table, represent the most stable and interactive nodes in the resonant
network. Their identification suggests that an element’s position in the network is
determined by its resonant properties, not its atomic number.
􏚴.􏚵 The Refined UBP Resonant Network and Prediction of
Hypothetical Elements
Based on the patterns observed in the initial full table analysis, we refined our CRV
scaling rules, introducing new families based on higher powers of the fundamental
constants (e.g., phi_cubed ) and additional roots (e.g., sqrt3 , sqrt5 ). We then used
this refined model to predict the CRVs and NRCIs of 􏚳􏚵 hypothetical superheavy
elements.
The entire analysis was then re-run with the expanded set of 􏚲􏚵􏚳 elements (􏚲􏚲􏚹 real
and 􏚳􏚵 hypothetical). This refined analysis yielded a global mean pairwise NRCI of
􏚱.􏚺􏚺􏚱􏚹, a significant increase from the initial analysis and a strong validation of the
refined CRV scaling rules. The distribution of the average NRCI for the 􏚲􏚵􏚳 elements is
shown in Figure 􏚲 ( 1000004902.png )
.
The refined analysis also produced a more detailed and structured Resonant Network,
as visualized in Figure 􏚳 ( 1000004901.png )
. This network clearly shows the elements clustering into “Stability Islands” based
on their CRV family. The refined model also confirmed the existence of Coherence
Hubs, with some of the hypothetical elements emerging as top hubs, validating the
predictive power of the UBP framework. The top coherence hubs in the refined 􏚲􏚵􏚳-
element network included both real and hypothetical elements, such as Helium (Z=􏚳),
Neon (Z=􏚲􏚱), Barium (Z=􏚶􏚷), and the hypothetical element Z=􏚲􏚳􏚸.
Furthermore, the refined analysis revealed a sub-network of biological elements (O, S,
Ca, Mn, Fe, I) with an exceptionally high average coherence of 􏚱.􏚺􏚺􏚳􏚶, suggesting that
the principles of UBP and resonant coherence may play a crucial role in the chemistry
of life.
Finally, a comparison of the UBP network structure with the standard periodic table
showed only a weak correlation with group number (Pearson: 􏚱.􏚲􏚸􏚺􏚶) and a moderate
correlation with period number (Pearson: 􏚱.􏚷􏚶􏚹􏚴), as shown in Figure 􏚴
( 1000004900.png ). This confirms that the UBP Resonant Network is a fundamentally
different organizational structure for the elements, based on resonance and coherence
rather than electron shell configurations.
􏚵. Discussion
The results of our computational experiments present a compelling case for a new
understanding of the periodic table, one based on the principles of resonance and
coherence as defined by the Universal Binary Principle. This section discusses the
interpretation and implications of our findings, focusing on the concept of a Resonant
Network, the significance of Coherence Hubs and Stability Islands, and the predictive
power of the UBP framework.
􏚵.􏚲 The Resonant Network: A New Paradigm for Elemental
Organization
The most significant finding of this study is the emergence of a “Resonant Network”
of elements, a complex, multi-dimensional structure that deviates significantly from
the linear, grid-like organization of the standard periodic table. This network,
visualized in Figure 􏚳, is not organized by atomic number but by the principles of
resonance and coherence. The connections between the nodes (elements) in this
network are not arbitrary; they represent strong, coherent resonant bonds, as
quantified by the high pairwise NRCI values between them. This suggests that the
stability and interactions of the elements are governed by a “chemical grammar” of
resonance, where elements combine and interact based on the harmonic relationships
between their Core Resonance Values.
The weak correlation between the UBP network structure and the standard periodic
table’s groups and periods (Figure 􏚴) further underscores the fundamental difference
between the two models. While the standard model, based on electron shell
configurations, has been incredibly successful in predicting chemical reactivity, the
UBP model suggests that there is a deeper, more fundamental organizing principle at
play. The moderate correlation with period number (Pearson: 􏚱.􏚷􏚶􏚹􏚴) is intriguing and
may suggest a link between the energy levels of electron shells and the resonant
frequencies of the elements, a possibility that warrants further investigation.
􏚵.􏚳 Coherence Hubs and Stability Islands: The Key Nodes of the
Network
Within the Resonant Network, certain elements and clusters of elements play a
particularly important role. The “Coherence Hubs” ‒ elements with the highest
average NRCI ‒ act as the central, most stable and interactive nodes in the network.
These hubs, which include both light and heavy elements, as well as hypothetical
superheavy elements, are the anchors of the resonant structure. Their existence
suggests that the stability of the periodic table is not uniform but is concentrated in
these key nodes.
The “Stability Islands,” which correspond to the clusters of elements from the same
CRV family, represent another key feature of the Resonant Network. These islands are
regions of high coherence, where the elements share a common resonant mode. The
fact that these islands are so clearly defined in the refined network analysis (Figure 􏚳)
provides strong support for the CRV family concept and the idea that the elements are
fundamentally grouped by their resonant signatures.
The identification of a highly coherent sub-network of biological elements (O, S, Ca,
Mn, Fe, I) is another significant finding. The fact that these elements, which are
essential for life as we know it, form a particularly stable and interactive cluster within
the Resonant Network suggests that the principles of UBP and resonant coherence
may be fundamental to the chemistry of life. This opens up a new and exciting avenue
for research into the energetic basis of biological systems.
􏚵.􏚴 The Predictive Power of the UBP Framework
One of the most compelling aspects of the UBP framework is its predictive power. By
refining our CRV scaling rules based on the observed coherence patterns, we were able
to predict the existence and properties of 􏚳􏚵 hypothetical superheavy elements. The
fact that several of these hypothetical elements emerged as top Coherence Hubs in the
refined network analysis provides strong validation for the predictive capabilities of
the UBP model.
This predictive power is not limited to the existence of new elements. The UBP
framework can also be used to predict the stability and reactivity of different
combinations of elements. The pairwise NRCI matrix provides a quantitative measure
of the coherence of any given pair of elements, allowing us to predict which
combinations are most likely to form stable, resonant structures. This has significant
implications for materials science and the design of new materials with specific
properties.
􏚵.􏚵 Limitations and Future Directions
While the results of this study are promising, it is important to acknowledge its
limitations. The UBP is a theoretical framework, and the CRV and NRCI are theoretical
constructs. While our computational experiments provide strong evidence for the
validity of these concepts, they are not a substitute for experimental verification.
Future research should focus on developing experimental methods to measure the
resonant properties of the elements and to test the predictions of the UBP model.
Another limitation of this study is that it is based on a specific set of CRV scaling rules.
While these rules were refined based on the data, it is possible that there are other,
more accurate ways to model the resonant properties of the elements. Future research
should explore alternative CRV models and continue to refine the UBP framework.
Despite these limitations, this study represents a significant step forward in our
understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the organization of the
elements. The UBP framework and the concept of a Resonant Network offer a new and
powerful paradigm for interpreting the periodic table, one that has the potential to
revolutionize our understanding of chemistry, materials science, and even biology.
􏚶. Conclusion
This study has introduced a novel approach to understanding the periodic table of
elements, grounded in the theoretical framework of the Universal Binary Principle. By
modeling the elements as resonant systems and quantifying their interactions through
the Non-Random Coherence Index, we have uncovered a new organizational structure
for the elements: a multi-dimensional Resonant Network. Our findings demonstrate
that this network, based on the principles of resonance and coherence, provides a
more fundamental and predictive model of elemental relationships than the standard
periodic table.
The key conclusions of this research are as follows:
􏚲. Resonance, not arithmetic progression, governs elemental coherence. Our
analysis of Terrence Howard’s powers-of-􏚳 model showed that simple
arithmetic progressions do not produce coherent systems within the UBP
framework. In contrast, a model based on Core Resonance Values scaled by
fundamental mathematical constants (φ, e, √􏚳) achieved a high degree of
coherence, suggesting that the elements are organized according to harmonic
principles.
􏚳. The elements form a Resonant Network. Our comprehensive analysis of all 􏚲􏚲􏚹
known elements and 􏚳􏚵 hypothetical elements revealed a complex network of
resonant interactions. This network is not organized by atomic number but by
the resonant properties of the elements, as defined by their CRV family and their
pairwise NRCI.
􏚴. The UBP framework has significant predictive power. The UBP model not only
accounts for the properties of the known elements but also predicts the
existence and characteristics of new, stable superheavy elements. The
emergence of hypothetical elements as key Coherence Hubs in our refined
network analysis provides strong validation for the predictive capabilities of the
UBP framework.
􏚵. The UBP offers a new lens for interpreting elemental properties. The concept
of a Resonant Network, with its Coherence Hubs and Stability Islands, provides a
new and powerful paradigm for understanding the stability, reactivity, and
relationships of the elements. This has significant implications for a wide range
of scientific disciplines, from chemistry and materials science to biology.
In conclusion, this research has demonstrated that the Universal Binary Principle
provides a robust and predictive framework for understanding the fundamental
principles that govern the organization of matter. The Resonant Network model of the
periodic table, with its emphasis on resonance and coherence, represents a significant
departure from the standard model and opens up new and exciting avenues for future
research. We believe that this work lays the foundation for a new, more fundamental
understanding of the elements and their role in the universe.
